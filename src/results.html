The beneficiaries have very varied backgrounds but all share the same objective, to succeed in their high-level training project within one of the best engineering schools in France (AQUI, Poner un hyperlink, sea del palmares grand écoles, or directly on the INSA page).

        <h2>more about them</h2>
        <div>
          <h3>Who is Mariana?</h3>
          <p>
            Currently in her 4th year of studies in the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, Mariana Vargas Claros came to France because the specialty she wanted to pursue did not exist in Bolivia.
            Passionate about the functioning and the mysteries yet to be discovered of the human body, Mariana would like to devote herself to the study of the immunity of the human body (PODRIAMOS SER MAS PRECISOS EN EL PROYECTO QUE TIENE, SE ESCUCHA SUPER PADRE). While studying in France, Mariana is sensitive to the issues of access to quality health services, and wishes to contribute to the development of new treatments in order to help as many people as possible.
          </p>
          <h4>Mariana is also...</h4>
          <p>
            A diligent person, very attached to his family and its values. She is very perseverant and does everything necessary to achieve her goals!
            Mariana is passionate about reading (an author who inspires her?), spending time with family, playing volleyball and watching series.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Who is Christian?</h3>
          <p>
            Christian Delgado Díaz de León is a 5th year Mexican student in the Electrical Engineering department at INSA Lyon. Christian is a person who works with great perseverance to achieve his goals.
            When he was in high school in Mexico City, he explored different options to pursue higher education. Christian had in mind to discover a new culture, learn a new language and train within a recognized institution. The opportunity to come to the city of Lyon, to a school recognized for its level of excellence and its international outlook, perfectly matched his wishes!
          
            Christian is a studious person who likes to work to achieve his goals.
          </p>
          <h4>Christian is also...</h4>
          <p>
            A student who does not count his hours to train.
            If studies are his priority, Christian also loves doing sports (alguno in particular?), multicultural meetings to practice other languages (cuales) and meeting people from the four corners of the world, and above all getting involved in good things (????? get involved in causes that are close to his heart?).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Who is Juan?</h3>
          <p>
            Juan Lara Cruz graduated in 2019 from the Electrical Engineering specialty at INSA Lyon. Currently he works in a design office in the railway sector.
            His motivation to excel in his studies, the desire to discover new cultures and the idea of setting new challenges brought Juan to France.
            One of his strengths is that he always seeks to see the positive side of situations to overcome everyday obstacles.
          </p>
          <h4>Juan is also...</h4>
          <p>
            A fan of Latin dances, especially salsa and bachata). Moments with friends are also a source of life satisfaction, where jokes and good humor are always present!
            Always up for new adventures, he loves traveling to discover other cultures and ways of life.
