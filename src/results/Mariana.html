            <p class="p-text mt-2 mb-8">
                Currently in her 4th year of studies in the Biosciences department at INSA Lyon, Mariana Vargas Claros came to France because the specialty she wanted to pursue did not exist in Bolivia.
                Passionate about the functioning and the mysteries yet to be discovered of the human body, Mariana would like to devote herself to the study of the immunity of the human body (PODRIAMOS SER MAS PRECISOS EN EL PROYECTO QUE TIENE, SE ESCUCHA SUPER PADRE). While studying in France, Mariana is sensitive to the issues of access to quality health services, and wishes to contribute to the development of new treatments in order to help as many people as possible.

            <h2 class="h-text text-2xl">Mariana is also...</h2>
            <p class="p-text mt-2 mb-8">
                A diligent person, very attached to his family and its values. She is very perseverant and does everything necessary to achieve her goals!
                Mariana is passionate about reading (an author who inspires her?), spending time with family, playing volleyball and watching series.
